## 📊 Overview  

Mountain Duck provides a streamlined way to connect remote servers and cloud storage directly to your system by mounting them as traditional drives. This approach enables you to interact with remote files using your native file manager, letting you navigate, open, and organize data just as you would with local folders. By consolidating multiple external sources into one interface, it eliminates the need to jump across apps or platforms.  

The software supports a broad set of services and protocols, ranging from FTP and SFTP to modern cloud platforms such as Amazon S3, Azure, Google Cloud Storage, Backblaze B2, and others. After mounting a connection, all files become instantly available for use, with the system handling remote operations in the background. This makes working with distributed storage fast, intuitive, and highly flexible.  

Mountain Duck also places a strong emphasis on data safety. Built-in encryption ensures that sensitive files and credentials stay protected during transfer and access. The app’s intelligent caching helps improve performance by reducing loading times and minimizing repeated requests, particularly when handling frequent file operations.  

Whether you're collaborating with remote teams, managing server directories, or accessing multiple cloud sources, Mountain Duck provides a stable and efficient workspace. It’s designed to handle demanding workflows while keeping your system responsive and uncluttered. By transforming remote storage into native drives, it makes cloud and server resources feel naturally integrated into your daily routine.
